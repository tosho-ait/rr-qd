# React Redux - Quick and Dirty

React Redux - Quick and Dirty is an "almost framework" based on React, Redux (obviously :-)) and Redux Api Middleware. 
It is intended to handle routing, authentication and authorisation, backend calls and other aspects present in most web apps. 

Note, at the moment it is just a side project of mine. It is quite unpolished and undocumented, sorry for that :-(

If you want to know more, you can take a look at the [example application](https://github.com/tosho-ait/rr-qd-example-auth/blob/master/README.md)
